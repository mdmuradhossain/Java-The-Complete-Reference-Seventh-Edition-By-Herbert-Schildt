# I/O, Applets, and Other Topics

This chapter introduces two of Java’s most important packages: io and applet. The io
package supports Java’s basic I/O (input/output) system, including file I/O. The applet
package supports applets. Support for both I/O and applets comes from Java’s core
API libraries, not from language keywords. For this reason, an in-depth discussion of these
topics is found in Part II of this book, which examines Java’s API classes. This chapter discusses
the foundation of these two subsystems so that you can see how they are integrated into the
Java language and how they fit into the larger context of the Java programming and execution
environment. This chapter also examines the last of Java’s keywords: transient, volatile,
instanceof, native, strictfp, and assert. It concludes by examining static import and by
describing another use for the this keyword.
