# The History and Evolution of Java

To fully understand Java, one must understand the reasons behind its creation, the
forces that shaped it, and the legacy that it inherits. Like the successful computer
languages that came before, Java is a blend of the best elements of its rich heritage
combined with the innovative concepts required by its unique mission. While the remaining
chapters of this book describe the practical aspects of Java—including its syntax, key libraries,
and applications—this chapter explains how and why Java came about, what makes it so
important, and how it has evolved over the years.
Although Java has become inseparably linked with the online environment of the
Internet, it is important to remember that Java is first and foremost a programming language.
Computer language innovation and development occurs for two fundamental reasons:

	- To adapt to changing environments and uses
	- To implement refinements and improvements in the art of programming

As you will see, the development of Java was driven by both elements in nearly equal
measure.
